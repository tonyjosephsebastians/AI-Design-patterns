# 🧠 Master Pattern Map — Production AI & Backend Systems

This repository is a **learning + reference system** for mastering **90 critical design patterns** required to build **production-grade AI systems** (LLMs, RAG, agents, APIs).

⚠️ This is **not** a textbook or GoF summary.  
This is a **failure-driven pattern map**, based on how real systems break in production.

---

## 🎯 How to Think About Patterns (READ THIS FIRST)

❌ Do NOT learn patterns by:
- memorizing definitions
- reading GoF chapters in order
- copying UML diagrams

✅ Learn patterns by:
- **triggering real failures**
- **fixing those failures with patterns**
- **placing patterns inside a real system**

> **Patterns exist because something breaks without them.**

---

## 🧭 How to Use This Repository

### The Correct Learning Method
For **each group**:

1. **Trigger the failure**
2. **Feel the pain**
3. **Apply the patterns in that group**
4. **Move on only when the failure is resolved**

⚠️ Never learn patterns individually.  
Patterns **only make sense in groups**.

## 🧭 Final Learning Rules (IMPORTANT)

- ❌ Never memorize pattern names
- ❌ Never learn patterns in isolation
- ✅ Always start with the failure
- ✅ Always place the pattern in the system
- ✅ Always explain trade-offs

> **If you can explain why NOT to use a pattern, you truly understand it.**

## 🎤 Interview Reality

You do **not** need to recite 90 patterns.

You need to:
- deeply understand **20–30**
- recognize the rest
- apply them naturally while designing systems

This map ensures you reach that level.

---

## ✅ Recommended Order

1. Group 1 (Foundation — async, jobs, reliability)  
2. Group 2 (Idempotency & correctness)  
3. Group 3 (State & persistence)  
4. Group 5 (RAG correctness)  
5. Group 6 (Agent workflows)  
6. Group 8 (Observability)  
7. Group 9 (Cost & governance)  
8. Remaining GoF groups as needed
